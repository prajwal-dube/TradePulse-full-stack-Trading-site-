# TradePulse – Full Stack Trading Platform

TradePulse is a full-stack trading platform designed to simulate core functionalities of a modern stock trading system. The project focuses on clean software architecture by separating the application into **frontend**, **backend**, and **dashboard** modules, reflecting real-world engineering practices.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

TradePulse is built to model essential trading concepts such as:
- Orders
- Holdings
- Positions
- Watchlists
- Trading dashboards and visualizations

The project emphasizes **modular design**, **maintainable code structure**, and **clear separation of concerns**, making it suitable as a software engineering project rather than just a UI demo.
